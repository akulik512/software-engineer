# Terminology

The**pivot index**is the index where the sum of all the numbers**strictly**to the left of the index is equal to the sum
of all the numbers**strictly**to the index's right.

In mathematics, an **isomorphism** is a structure-preserving mapping between two structures of the same type that can be
reversed by an inverse mapping. Two mathematical structures are isomorphic if an isomorphism exists between them. The
word isomorphism is derived from the Ancient Greek: ἴσος isos "equal", and μορφή morphe "form" or "shape".
